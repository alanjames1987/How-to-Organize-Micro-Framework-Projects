Any capitalized string or name of file or folder represents something that should be changed to match your needs.

Express
---

This application is built primarily around Express, but also includes some other popular Node libraries listed below.

[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB Model Layer
[Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) - WebSocket Framework
[EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) - Templating Engine Compatible with Standard HTML

Any of these libraries may be dropped or swapped for alternatives.

For Example:

An SQL alternative to Mongoose is [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/).  
A good Socket.IO alternative is [Primus](https://github.com/primus/primus).  
Two alternatives to EJS are [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). A community discussion of their merits is [here](https://github.com/expressjs/generator/issues/47).
